1. Do more expensive properties tend to have higher reviews scores?
There is a weak relationship between price and review score. It is unusual for expensive properties to have low review scores but high review scores are obtainable for cheaper properties.

2. Do properties with a flexible cancellation policy have higher review scores?
There is a weak relationship between cancellation booking flexibility and review score with more flexible policy properties having a marginally higher review score than those with moderate policies and (to a greater extent) strict policies.

3. Do properties with higher reviews more frequently booked up?
No, there appears to be no relationship between review score and availability.
